Kubeflow Pipelines is a platform for building and deploying portable, scalable machine learning (ML) workflows based on Docker containers. 
Each pipeline represents an ML workflow, and includes the specifications of all inputs needed to run the pipeline, as well the outputs of all components.
If you are not familar with the Kubeflow Pipeline, you can refer to :ref:`kubeflow_pipelines`.

In this tutorial, we would guide you through a concrete example to build up and run Kubeflow pipelines.





we provide you with a already-compiled pipeline YAML files for quick-test purpose. If you prefer that, feel free to skip to pipeline running part and use them.
